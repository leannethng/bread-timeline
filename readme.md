# Bread Timeline

- A little app that lets you plug in the length of time of different stages of creating bread.

- I found when creating bread myself, I struggled to figure out what time to start each stage given the time I wanted to bake the bread and what time the bread would need to be baked given when I wanted ot start prep.

- This app aims to give a visual representation of the bread making process with the parameters you give it.

- You can set:

  - Time to start prep
  - Time needed for each stage

- The app will display a timeline of the stages and the timings.

## Still to do

- [ ] Add a toggle for Am/Pm
- [ ] Add in the time beside the sliders
- [ ] Reset sliders on page refresh
- [ ] Different colors for different time segments
